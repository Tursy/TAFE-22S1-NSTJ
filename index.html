    <h1>Start Finance Assignment</h1>
    
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Under the request of the director of IT Works, a small team of plucky go-getters 
      has been contracted to build upon the Start Finance application. Employing a dazzling 
      array of industry-standard skills, ranging from Visual Studio know-how to GitHub 
      collaborative development, this small but daring underdog team is set to develop the 
      application's finance maintenance systems in a desperate attempt to meet the 
      ever-growing needs of its voracious userbase.</p>
